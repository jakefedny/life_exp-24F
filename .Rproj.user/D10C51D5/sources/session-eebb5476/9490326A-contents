9.2.1

-more and more solutions are being deployed for continuous use
- spotify and netflix is working all the time
- you want to make sure something is always working while you can also make edits
- dev, test, prod
- we want to add new capabilities without disturibing main base branch baseline until new version is ready

9.3
- branching allows each branch to have its own version of code, and supports seperation b/w developing, testing, and production

How do we make sure we're up to data on what's on Github?
- use git pull

-git branch -a
 - main is in green as that's what you're in
 
 
- its called branch as it will keep main branch working
